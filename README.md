# human-protein-image-classification
My code for the Kaggle competition, Zero to GANs - Human Protein Classification, hosted during a six-week course by Jovian.ml on freeCodeCamp. Came 167th out of 894 competitors. <br>
The dataset was excluded due to its size and can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/c/jovian-pytorch-z2g/data <br>
The dataset should be put inside a new folder named 'data'. <br>
